# The-Future-of-Mail
## Author: Ryan Matthews
## Project: The Future of Mail
## Project Description:
“The Future of Mail” is going to be a game using the Bevy Rust 3D game engine about a robot delivering mail. The goal will be to deliver mail and earn points. The main environment will be a cityscape. For the vision I imagine the aesthetic will be like the game ‘Crazy Taxi’. The main player will be a humanoid robot and I imagine the look will be like that one robot who shuts down while handling packages or the boston dynamics robots. I think the environment will be a cityscape with buildings and one part will have a waterfront type and if you fall in the water you fail. The main fail condition is if you run into a building, run out of time, or fall in the water. The main character will also maybe have a heat meter and the player will have to stop moving in order for the player to not fail.
